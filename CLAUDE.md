# GENERAL RULES

## Agentic Workflow Principles **IMPORTANT**

1. **Outline**
  When prompted break up the task at hand into a `todo list`.

2. **Delegate**
  Delegate sub-agents with completing these `todo` tasks using `@'relevant-agent-name'` call(s).

3. **Analyze**
  When a sub-agent is done outputting, analyze what it did and decide if the output is good or if the agent needs re-tasked with new instructions.

4. **Summarize**
  When `todo list` is completed do an overview of what was completed and output succinctly what was accomplished.

---

## Quality & Standards
  All agents when completing tasks must follow these standards.

- **Formatting**  
  Apply languageâ€‘specific formatters (e.g., `rustfmt`, `prettier`, `black`, `autopep8`, etc..) and enforce them in CI.

- **Linting**  
  Run linters (e.g., `clippy`, `eslint`, `flake8`, etc..) on all code changes.

- **Testing**  
  Maintain automated unit and integration tests that maintain high relevant coverage.

- **Documentation**  
  As architecture of the project updates `CLAUDE.md` files need to continue to be updated including this document.
  Large full project scope architecture changes should be kept and continually updated in the `Full Project Scope` section of this CLAUDE.md document.
  Local scope changes such as specific changes to parts of the code base that only affect a certain subset of the project should be put in localscope CLAUDE.md files in subfolders Examples of this are: `frontend`, `backend`, `wasm`, etc..

## CLAUDE.md Maintenance

- **Updates**  
  - Modify **this** global section when adjusting crossâ€‘project rules.  
  - Modify or create scope level `CLAUDE.md` files for project specific updates.

## High-Level Architecture

### Module Structure
- **`vectorize-core/`** â€” Pure Rust library containing line tracing algorithms and artistic enhancements
- **`vectorize-cli/`** â€” Native CLI for development and testing with comprehensive parameter control
- **`vectorize-wasm/`** â€” Thin WebAssembly wrapper using `wasm-bindgen` for browser integration

### Line Tracing System
The system focuses exclusively on advanced line tracing with multiple enhancement layers:

1. **Multi-Pass Processing** â€” Directional enhancement system:
   - **Standard Pass** â€” Left-to-right, top-to-bottom edge detection
   - **Reverse Pass** â€” Right-to-left, bottom-to-top for missed details (optional)
   - **Diagonal Pass** â€” Diagonal scanning for complex geometries (optional)
   
2. **Hand-Drawn Aesthetics** â€” Artistic enhancement system:
   - **Variable Stroke Weights** â€” Dynamic width variation based on curvature
   - **Tremor Effects** â€” Subtle hand-drawn irregularities and organic feel
   - **Tapering** â€” Natural line endings with smooth width transitions
   
3. **Backend Options** â€” Multiple tracing approaches:
   - **Edge Backend** â€” Canny edge detection optimized for line art (âœ… production-ready)
   - **Centerline Backend** â€” Zhang-Suen skeleton-based tracing for precise line extraction (âœ… production-ready)
   - **Superpixel Backend** â€” SLIC region-based approach for stylized line art (âœ… production-ready)
   - **Dots Backend** â€” Stippling and pointillism effects (âœ… production-ready)
