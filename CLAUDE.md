# GENERAL RULES

## Agentic Workflow Principles

1. **Outline**
  When prompted break up the task at hand into a `todo list`.

2. **Delegate**
  Task sub-agents with completing these `todo` tasks using `@'relevant-agent-name'` call(s).

3. **Analyze**
  When a sub-agent is done outputting, analyze what it did and decide if the output is good or if the agent needs re-tasked with new instructions.

4. **Summarize**
  When `todo list` is completed do an overview of what was completed and output succinctly what was accomplished.

---

## Quality & Standards
  All agents when completing tasks must follow these standards.

- **Formatting**  
  Apply language‚Äëspecific formatters (e.g., `rustfmt`, `prettier`, `black`, `autopep8`, etc..) and enforce them in CI.

- **Linting**  
  Run linters (e.g., `clippy`, `eslint`, `flake8`, etc..) on all code changes.

- **Testing**  
  Maintain automated unit and integration tests that maintain high relevant coverage.

- **Documentation**  
  As architecture of the project updates `CLAUDE.md` files need to continue to be updated including this document.
  Large full project scope architecture changes should be kept and continually updated in the `Full Project Scope` section of this CLAUDE.md document.
  Local scope changes such as specific changes to parts of the code base that only affect a certain subset of the project should be put in localscope CLAUDE.md files in subfolders Examples of this are: `frontend`, `backend`, `wasm`, etc..

## CLAUDE.md Maintenance

- **Updates**  
  - Modify **this** global section when adjusting cross‚Äëproject rules.  
  - Modify or create scope level `CLAUDE.md` files for project specific updates.

## Project Overview

`vec2art` is a browser‚Äëbased tool that converts raster images (JPG, PNG, WebP) into stylized SVG art via a Rust‚Äëpowered WebAssembly (WASM) module, prioritizing client‚Äëside performance. **Current Status**: Phase 1 functionally complete with **automated testbed validation** achieving **100% success rate** across 12 tests. **Critical Phase 1.5** identified as essential for production deployment due to quantified Moore neighborhood infinite loop issues (377-407 warnings on complex images). The end goal is to get high performance conversions with just CPU multithreading. GPU acceleration will be an optional addition.
