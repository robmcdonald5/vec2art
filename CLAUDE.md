# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude when working on the `vec2art` project. It outlines the project architecture, technology stack, and the development workflow.

## Project Overview

`vec2art` is a browser-based tool for converting raster images (JPG, PNG, WebP) into stylized SVG art using a Rust-powered WebAssembly (WASM) module. The project emphasizes client-side processing for user privacy and high performance.

## Core Directive: Maintain This Document ðŸ“œ

After any significant code change, architectural decision, or workflow modification, you must pause and consider if this `CLAUDE.md` file needs to be updated to reflect the change.

### Decision Framework for Updates

* **Global Rules**: If the change affects the overall project structure, high-level strategy, or cross-cutting concerns, the update belongs in this **root `CLAUDE.md` file**.
* **Local Rules**: If the change introduces rules or conventions that are specific to a single directory (e.g., a new required format for all algorithms in `wasm/src/algorithms/`), you should propose creating a **new, more specific `CLAUDE.md` file inside that subdirectory**.

When bugs are fixed, complicated algorithms or methods are implemented, or general missteps are addressed, consider if it is a good idea to document these changes. The purpose is to ensure critical big-picture ideas are continually documented in the root `CLAUDE.md`, while smaller, but still important, architectural decisions are tracked without cluttering this document.

If you believe an update is needed, please state the proposed change and its location (root or sub-folder) and ask for my approval to update or add documentation.

* **Details**: See `wasm/CLAUDE.md` for implementation specifics

### Frontend Stack (SvelteKit)
* **Framework**: SvelteKit 5 + Tailwind CSS 4
* **Language**: TypeScript
* **Package Manager**: `npm`
* **Testing**: `vitest` for unit tests, `playwright` for end-to-end tests
* **Details**: See `frontend/CLAUDE.md` for implementation specifics

## Professional Setup & Workflow

### Dependency Management
* **Rust/WASM**: `cargo` is the source of truth. Dependencies in `wasm/Cargo.toml`, locked in `wasm/Cargo.lock`.
* **SvelteKit**: `npm` is the source of truth. Dependencies in `frontend/package.json`, locked in `frontend/package-lock.json`.

### Code Quality & Formatting
* **Rust**: `rustfmt` for formatting, `clippy` for linting
* **SvelteKit/TypeScript**: `Prettier` for formatting, `ESLint` for linting

### Git & Commit Conventions
Follow **Conventional Commits** specification:
* `feat:` New feature
* `fix:` Bug fix
* `docs:` Documentation changes
* `test:` Test additions or changes
* `refactor:` Code refactoring
* `perf:` Performance improvements
* `chore:` Maintenance tasks

Examples: `feat: add geometric fitter algorithm`, `fix: correct SVG download filename`

### CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions)
Every PR against `main` must pass:
1. **Format Check**: `cargo fmt --check`, `npm run format-check`
2. **Lint Check**: `cargo clippy`, `npm run lint`
3. **Tests**: `cargo test`, `wasm-pack test`, `npm run test`

## Phased Development Workflow

### Phase 1: Core Algorithm Development (**CURRENT PHASE**)
**Goal**: Build and test core conversion algorithms in Rust/WASM
1. Implement `PathTracer` algorithm (MVP)
2. Test-driven development with `cargo test`
3. Define parameter structs for JS interop via `serde`

### Phase 2: Frontend Scaffolding & MVP Integration
**Goal**: Working single-image editor with `PathTracer`
1. Build UI components: file input, control panel, preview
2. TypeScript/WASM integration layer
3. Complete flow: upload â†’ process â†’ download

### Phase 3: Feature Expansion
**Goal**: Additional algorithms and multi-image blending
1. Add `GeometricFitter` and `EdgeDetector` algorithms
2. Implement compositional (layer-based) blending
3. Advanced blending modes (style transfer)

### Phase 4: Polish & Deploy
**Goal**: Production-ready application
1. End-to-end testing with Playwright
2. WASM optimization for size and speed
3. Deploy to static hosting (Vercel/Cloudflare Pages)

## Agent Invocation Framework

### Main Session: "General Contractor"
The primary Claude session holds full project context and handles:
* Multi-file changes and architectural decisions
* Complex business logic requiring full context
* Code review and agent output validation

### Specialist Agents: "Subcontractors"
Use `@-mention` agents for:
1. **Repetitive tasks**: Component generation, test files
2. **Low-context tasks**: Single function refactoring
3. **Precise formats**: Algorithm modules following trait definitions

**Note**: Agents are statelessâ€”each invocation is independent.

## Core WASM Module Interface

The primary interface between JavaScript and Rust:

```rust
#[wasm_bindgen]
pub fn convert(image_bytes: &[u8], params: ConversionParameters) -> Result<String, JsValue>
```

* **Input**: Raw image bytes and conversion parameters
* **Output**: SVG string or error
* **Details**: See `wasm/CLAUDE.md` for implementation

* `/setup-project` - Initial project setup with all tools
* `/wasm-build [dev|prod]` - Build WASM module
* `/wasm-test [chrome|firefox]` - Run WASM tests
* `/analyze-wasm` - Analyze binary size
* `/ci-check` - Run all CI checks locally
