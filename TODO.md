## Phase 1: Native Core Development ‚úÖ (Functionally Complete)

> **Status Update (Aug 8, 2025)**: Phase 1 is functionally complete with working algorithms and significant performance optimizations. All three crates are implemented with actual algorithm logic (not placeholders). Logo algorithm has functional but problematic Moore neighborhood contour tracing that causes infinite loops on complex images. Regions algorithm achieved dramatic performance improvements from 50-130s to <1s processing time through optimized k-means and unified preprocessing. CLI is fully functional with proper argument parsing. Ready for Phase 1.5 contour tracing algorithm replacement.

### Workspace & Tooling

## Phase 1.5: Critical Algorithm Fixes üîß (Suzuki-Abe Implementation)

> **Priority**: CRITICAL - Must be completed before Phase 2 to ensure production-ready logo algorithm

### Issue Resolution
- [x] **Identified Problem**: Moore neighborhood contour tracing causes infinite loops on complex/real images (300+ warnings)
- [x] **Research Completed**: 4 specialized research agents analyzed alternatives and implementation approaches
- [ ] **Implement Suzuki-Abe**: Replace Moore neighborhood with industry-standard Suzuki-Abe algorithm via `imageproc` crate
- [ ] **Integration Testing**: Verify infinite loop resolution on problematic test cases
- [ ] **Performance Validation**: Ensure Suzuki-Abe maintains or improves performance vs Moore neighborhood
- [ ] **Algorithm Comparison**: Document performance and quality differences between approaches

### Research Findings Summary
- **Suzuki-Abe Algorithm**: Industry standard for contour detection, handles complex topologies, no infinite loop issues
- **imageproc Integration**: `find_contours_with_threshold()` provides direct drop-in replacement
- **Expected Benefits**: Eliminates infinite loops, handles holes correctly, maintains performance
- **Implementation Path**: Replace Moore neighborhood in `algorithms/logo_mode.rs` with imageproc call

## Phase 2: WASM Integration üîÆ (CPU-only)

### Crate: `vectorize-wasm`
