### Issue Resolution (Testbed-Validated)
- [x] **Problem Quantified**: Moore neighborhood produces 377-407 warnings on real-world images (**4 out of 6 test images severely affected**)
- [x] **Concrete Evidence**: Testbed data confirms severe infinite loop issues on complex images (test1.png: 377 warnings, test2.png: 407 warnings)
- [x] **Performance Baseline Established**: Current logo algorithm: 0-1s processing time (when it completes)
- [x] **Research Completed**: 4 specialized research agents analyzed alternatives and implementation approaches
- [x] **Testbed Infrastructure**: Automated validation framework ready for Phase 1.5 testing
- [ ] **Implement Suzuki-Abe**: Replace Moore neighborhood with industry-standard Suzuki-Abe algorithm via `imageproc` crate
