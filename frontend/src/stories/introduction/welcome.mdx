# vec2art Design System

Welcome to the **vec2art** component library and design system documentation. This Storybook contains all the UI components, design tokens, and patterns used in the vec2art application.

## What is vec2art?

vec2art is a specialized browser-based tool that transforms raster images (JPG, PNG, WebP) into expressive line art SVGs via a high-performance Rust-powered WebAssembly (WASM) module. The application focuses on ultra-fast parallel processing with artistic enhancements to create beautiful, hand-drawn style line art.

## Design System Overview

Our design system is built on these core principles:

### üé® **Consistency**

- Unified color palette with semantic tokens
- Systematic spacing scale based on 4px increments
- Typography hierarchy using Inter font family
- Consistent component behavior and interactions

### ‚ôø **Accessibility First**

- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance across all components
- Full keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader optimized with proper ARIA attributes
- High contrast mode support
- Focus management and visual indicators

### üöÄ **Performance**

- SvelteKit 5 with modern runes syntax
- Optimized for browser performance
- Lazy loading and efficient rendering
- WebAssembly integration for CPU-intensive tasks

### üì± **Responsive Design**

- Mobile-first approach
- Fluid typography and spacing
- Adaptive layouts for all screen sizes
- Touch-friendly interactions

## Technology Stack

### Frontend Framework

- **SvelteKit 5** - Modern reactive framework with runes
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe development
